4.	WARRANTY, REMEDY, AND LIMITATIONS
A.	WISE GRANTS YOU A LIMITED WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL PERFORM IN SUBSTANTIAL ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOMPANYING USER MANUAL FOR NINETY (90) DAYS FOLLOWING YOUR RECEIPT OF THE SOFTWARE.  THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARRANTY.

B.	WISE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST WISE SHALL BE, AT WISE'S OPTION, (I) RETURN OF AMOUNTS PAID FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE; OR (II) REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF SOFTWARE WHICH DOES NOT MEET THE ABOVE LIMITED WARRANTY; PROVIDED YOU RETURN THE SOFTWARE TO WISE.

C.	SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN WARRANTY LIMITATIONS, SO THE RESTRICTIONS OF THIS SECTION 2 WILL APPLY TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE AND THE DOCUMENTATION SOLD WITH THIS PUBLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE REMAINS WITH YOU.  IN NO EVENT WILL WISE OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR OTHER ECONOMIC OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  WISE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THIS DOCUMENT AT ANY TIME WITHOUT OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY ANYONE.   IN NO EVENT SHALL WISE'S OR ITS SUPPLIERS' LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE SUM OF ANY AMOUNTS PAID HEREUNDER BY YOU TO WISE OR THE SUPPLIER.

5.	TERMINATION
The license will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms, conditions, or limitations contained in this EULA, including the payment of applicable license or other fees.  On termination, you shall, at Wise's option, either return to Wise or destroy all copies of the Software and documentation.  Otherwise, this EULA shall remain in force until terminated.  You may terminate this EULA at any time (with no obligation on the part of Wise) by destroying all copies of the Software, deleting any copies of the Software from your hard drives, ceasing all use of the Software and documentation; and providing satisfactory proof to Wise that you have done so.  The disclaimer of warranty and limitations on liability contained in Section 4 shall continue in force even after your rights to use the Software are terminated.

6.	UPGRADES
If the Software is designated by Wise as an "Upgrade" product, then you may only use the Software if you are also currently a licensed user of the base product to which the Upgrade applies.  Unless the Wise documentation for an Upgrade specifically provides, you shall not separate upgrade products from base products, nor transfer them separately.  Wise reserves the sole and exclusive right to set its policies and prices regarding updates, upgrades and enhancements.  All other terms of this EULA apply with equal force to any such Upgrades.

7.	DEMO OR EVALUATION VERSIONS
If Wise designates the Software as a "Demo" or "Evaluation" version, then your license rights under this EULA shall extend solely for a 30-day evaluation period, during which your use is restricted solely to allow you to determine whether to purchase an ongoing license to the Software.  You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Demo or Evaluation version of this Software, including documentation, for internal distribution, provided that any such copies are unmodified and exact.  You shall not charge or request donations for any such copies and distribute Demo or Evaluation versions of the Software to third parties without prior written permission.  Unregistered use of the Software, including documentation, beyond the 30-day evaluation period violates Wise's rights, as described above, including but not limited to Wise's rights under the United States Copyright Act.  You acknowledge that any Demo or Evaluation version is merely a technology demonstration that may not be at the level of performance or compatibility of generally available Wise products.  Demo or Evaluation versions are provided strictly on an "as is" basis and are subject to Section 4, above.
